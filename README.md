Code produced during Workshop For Her 2018 (analysing Pink Tax) - by Grupo Turing and Pyladies SP

This Jupiter Notebook was produced during the workshop. It analyses a Pink Tax dataset, comparing data of both feminine and masculine products of different categories.

Conclusion is that the mean value of products by category is bigger in feminine products than in masculine products.
